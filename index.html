                The first game is a thematic base of the series, however not necessary for understanding the whole series. It is a solid hack'n'slash.</a>

            The first game in the series developed by Eidos Interactive. It depictures a decaying world filled with vampires. It is a must-play for any man of culture.</a>

            <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/legacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_2"><img src="Soul-Reaver-2-cover.jpg" alt="Soul Reaver 2 cover">
                Technically the third game, Soul Reaver 2 is a direct sequel to Soul Reaver. It offers a much richer story and a unique mechanic of the past, the present and the future of Nosgoth.</a>

                This one is skippable. Technically a Soul Reaver 2 sequel, but the story and quality of writing leave a lot to desire.</a>

            <p>Surprisingly, the latest game in the series to be released was the very first one. So, if you want to show the publishers that you are still interested in the series, I encourage you to go and buy it. Just click the Blood Omen cover art above and it'll take you to the GOG product page. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact, I suggest that you buy the whole series. It definately won't hurt anyone, especially now that there are new right owners.</p>
            <p>If you are not new to the series, you may know that it wasn't finished. This is why it is so important to show <i>them</i> that we still need the last game.</p>
